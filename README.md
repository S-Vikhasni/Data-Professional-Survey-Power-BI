The dataset containing survey results from individuals working in data-related professions was sourced from GitHub in the form on an excel file where
data cleaning was performed to ensure accuracy and consistency. 

Then, an interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize key insights.

The metrics included average salary by occupation (Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Architect, etc.), favorite programming languages (Python, R, C/C++, etc.), 
and work-life balance satisfaction. The dashboard also showed salary satisfaction and difficulty of entering the data field based on the respondentsâ€™ feedback.
